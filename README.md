# Basic Calendar App by Diego Verdaguer

This is a simple React/TypeScript based calendar app with the
ability to create, update, and delete events. The project
was initially built using Vite. Code cleanup and refactoring is
pending.

# How to Use

1. Download this repository
2. CD into root folder and run `npm i` and `npm dev`
3. Calendar will run on localhost. Events will be saved to local storage and persist between use.

# Future enhancements

I am planning on adding the ability to upload a media library (for books, movies, and series)
with the ability to track progress every day.
